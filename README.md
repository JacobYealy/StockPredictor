# Purpose
This project aims to measure the effect that sentiment has on stock prediction software. This project utilizes the Keras library in Python to build LSTM models. After the LSTM models are trained and tested, one LSTM model will be given a sentiment feature, and the accuracy of each LSTM to true market values will be evaluated.

# Requirements
To install all requirements, use pip install -r requirements.txt
* Keras, used to build the LSTM model
* Tensorflow, the ML library Keras is built on
* YFinance, the source of the stock data
* SQLite, the database used to store the data.
