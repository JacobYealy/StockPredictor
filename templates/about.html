        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <p>
            This Project is Jacob Yealy's capstone project for CSC-499 at Shippensburg University. <br>
            The purpose of this project is to analyze the impact that sentiment has on the United States Stock Market. <br>
            To do so, two LSTM networks were trained. Both networks were trained on an 80/20 training and testing split. <br>
            One network only utilized stock data, while the second utilized both stock and sentiment data. <br>
            Using the resulting predictions from the models, a positive or negative impact of sentiment on stock price could be analyzed.

        <h3>Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
            To complete the goals of this project, stock and sentiment data was needed. <br>
            6 months of stock data was pulled from YFinance, and 6 months of sentiment data was pulled from Alpha Vantage. <br>
            After the data was pulled, it was organized by date and stored in an SQLite database. <br>
            Next, the data was pulled from the database tables and preprocessed using the MinMaxScaler from SciKitLearn. This ensured that
            data was normalized to be processed easier, and ensured that the LSTM model wouldn't weigh one feature over another. <br>
            Stock data and sentiment data are combined based on dates, ensuring that the sentiment of a particular day corresponds with the stock price of that day.
            If sentiment data is presented to the model, it is combined with the stock data. If sentiment data is not present, only stock data is processed.
            This allows for the two separate predictions - one based on stock only data, and one based on the combined data. <br>
            Instead of daily data, the project uses weekly data, reducing noise and making the model less prone to over-fitting on short-term fluctuations. <br>

        <h3>LSTM Networks</h3>
        <p>
            The Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem. <br>
            In traditional RNNs, the vanishing gradient problem arises due to the chain rule applied during backpropagation.
            Specifically, when we repeatedly multiply gradients less than 1, the gradients become miniscule, essentially no longer updating weights.
            Since LSTMs have the cell state which has linear interactions (additions), this helps to avoid the vanishing gradient problem caused
            by the tanh activations in the recurrent path of basic RNNs. <br>
            Capturing long term as well as short term dependencies makes the LSTM ideal for time series data such as stock market data. <br>
            The LSTM model in this project is built using the Keras Sequential API. It creates a bidirectional LSTM layer that can capture patterns in forward and backward
            sequences of the data. <br>
            Adam (short for Adaptive Moment Estimation) is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm.
            It's known to outperform many other optimizers of its type. <br>
            Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a standard loss function for regression problems.
            It measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, punishing larger errors more than smaller ones. This makes it ideal for stock predictions. <br>
